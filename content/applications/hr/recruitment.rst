Recruitment
===========

Odoo keeps all job applicants organized with a pre-configured series of steps, and stages that each
applicant goes through. Each stage has a specific step(s) that should be performed. These range from
scheduling a phone call, conducting an interview, or sending a job offer, for example. This process
is referred to as the 'applicant flow'.

When an applicant applies for a job position, an *applicant card* is automatically created in Odoo's
*Recruitment* app for that specific job position. As the applicant progresses through the
recruitment pipeline, the recruitment team moves their card from one stage to the next.

:ref:`Stages can be configured <recruitment/modify-stages>` so that an email is automatically sent
out using a set, pre-configured template as soon as an applicant's card enters a stage. These
automated emails are defined on each stage in the applicant flow.

The applicant flow explained in this document is the default flow in Odoo, and goes through the
applicant flow when using the *Recruitment* application's default configuration. The applicant flow
is able to be modified to suit the specific recruitment flow for any business.

.. note::
   The applicant flow with all its stages are universal and applies to all job positions, unless
   specified. :ref:`A specific stage can be configured <recruitment/customize-stages>` to be
   job-specific, meaning that specific stage is only visible for that specific job position.
   Otherwise, if a new stage is created, or an existing stage is modified, those changes are
   visible on all job positions.

.. _recruitment/settings:

Settings
========

Before creating a job position in Odoo, configure the necessary settings for the *Recruitment* app.
To view and edit the settings, navigate to :menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Settings`. After any
changes are made, click the :guilabel:`Save` button in the top-left corner to save all the changes.

Job posting
-----------

The *Job Posting* section of the *Recruitment* app settings has only one selection to make. If job
positions are to be posted to the company's website, enable the :guilabel:`Online Posting` option.

.. note::
   This option only works if the *Website* application is also installed.

Recruitment process
-------------------

This section of the settings page specifies what the database can and cannot do during the
recruitment process.

Send interview survey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo is capable of having a survey sent to an applicant to gather more information about them.
Surveys can be thought of as exams, or questionnaires, and can be customized in various ways to
provide the recruitment team with valuable insights into the applicant

Enable the :guilabel:`Send Interview Survey` option to send surveys to applicants. Once enabled, an
:guilabel:`➡️ Interview Survey` internal link button appears. Click the :guilabel:`➡️ Interview
Survey` button to navigate to a list of all created surveys.

This list includes all surveys that were created in the database, not just surveys used in the
*Recruitment* app. If no surveys have been created, the surveys list displays a `No Survey Found`
message, and presents options to create a survey from several pre-configured surveys.

For more detailed information about surveys, refer to the :doc:`survey essentials
</applications/marketing/surveys/create>` documentation.

.. note::
   When the :guilabel:`Send Interview Survey` option is enabled, if the *Surveys* module is not
   already installed, it is installed once the settings are saved.

Send SMS
~~~~~~~~

It is possible to send text messages to applicants directly through the *Payroll* app. To do so,
enable the :guilabel:`Send SMS` option. This option requires credits to use, which can be obtained
by clicking the :guilabel:`➡️ Buy credits` internal link that emerges when the feature is enabled.

For more information, refer to the :doc:`SMS pricing and FAQs
</applications/marketing/sms_marketing/pricing/pricing_and_faq>` documentation.

.. _recruitment/cv-display:

CV display
~~~~~~~~~~

When applicants submit an application, one of the default required fields is a resumé, or :abbr:`CV
(curriculum vitae)`. All resumés are stored in the *Documents* application, and are accessible on
the applicant's card.

A resumé has the option to appear on the applicant's form, which can be viewed by clicking on the
applicant's card. The resumé appears on the right-side of the screen. If this is not enabled, the
resumé is accessed via a link in the chatter, where it needs to be clicked to expand and view it, or
downloaded.

Enable the :guilabel:`CV Display` option to show the resumé on the applicant's card by default, and
in addition to the document link. When enabled, the resumé appears on the right side of the
applicant's card.

.. note::
   If the window or tab is not wide enough, the resumé does not appear. The screen must be wide
   enough to accommodate the resumé. The full-screen view typically accommodates this view.

.. image:: recruitment/cv-display.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The resumé on an applicant's card, appearing on the right side.

.. _recruitment/cv-ocr:

CV digitization (OCR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an application is submitted using any of the available methods, such as an online application
submission, emailing a resume to the job position alias, or creating an applicant record directly
from the database, it is possible to have Odoo extract the applicant's name, phone number, and email
address from he resumé and populate the applicant's form. To do so, enable the :guilabel:`CV
Digitization (OCR)` option.

When enabled, additional options appear. Click on the corresponding radio button to select one of
the following options:

- :guilabel:`Do not digitize`: this option turns off resumé digitization.
- :guilabel:`Digitize on demand only`: this option only digitizes resumes when requested. A
  :guilabel:`Digitize document` buttons appears on applicant cards. When clicked, the resumé is
  scanned and the applicant's card is updated.
- :guilabel:`Digitize automatically`: this option automatically digitizes all resumés when they are
  submitted.

Beneath these options are two additional links. Click the :guilabel:`→ Buy credits` button to
purchase credits for CV digitization. Click the :guilabel:`→ View My Services` to view a list of all
current services, and their remaining credit balances.

For more information on document digitization and :abbr:`IAP's (in-app purchases)`, refer to the
:doc:`In-app purchase (IAP) <../essentials/in_app_purchase>` documentation.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Do not digitize` option for :guilabel:`CV digitization (OCR)` at first may seem
   like a redundancy. It seems to be the same as disabling the :guilabel:`CV digitization (OCR)`
   option.

   When the :guilabel:`CV digitization (OCR)` option is enabled, a module is installed so that
   resumés can be scanned. Disabling this option would uninstall the module.

   If at some point, there is a desire to temporarily stop digitizing resumés, the :guilabel:`Do not
   digitize` option is selected. The reason this option is available is so that the module is not
   uninstalled, allowing for digitization to be enabled in the future by selecting one of the other
   two options.

Salary package configurator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When sending an offer to an applicant, an expiration date can be set on the offer. Enter the number
of days an offer is valid for in the :guilabel:`days` field. After the set amount of days has
passed, if the applicant has not accepted the offer, the offer is no longer available.

Kanban view
===========

To access the Kanban view for a job position, navigate to the main :menuselection:`Recruitment app`
dashboard, which is the default view when opening the application. All job positions appear on the
main dashboard. Click the :guilabel:`(#) New Applications` smart button on a job position card to
navigate to the Kanban view for all the applicants for that particular job position.

.. image:: recruitment/new-applicants-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Main dashboard view of job position card, showing new applications button.

Inside the job application, the Kanban stages appear, with all the applicants populated in their
respective columns, indicating what stage they are currently in. There are six default stages in
Odoo:

- :ref:`New <recruitment/new>`
- :ref:`Initial Qualification <recruitment/initial-qualification>`
- :ref:`First Interview <recruitment/first-interview>`
- :ref:`Second Interview <recruitment/second-interview>`
- :ref:`Contract Proposal <recruitment/contract-proposal>`
- :ref:`Contract Signed <recruitment/contract-signed>`

The last column, :guilabel:`Contract Signed`, is folded by default. Folded column appear gray, and
the applicants in it are hidden from view. To expand the folded stage and view the applicant cards
for that column, click anywhere on the thin gray column that says the stage name and the column
expands, revealing the applicants.

.. image:: recruitment/stages.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Expand a folded column by clicking on it in the Kanban view.

Each stage has a color-coded bar beneath the stage name, providing status information for the
applicant's in that specific stage. The status colors are:

- :guilabel:`Green`: the applicant is ready to move to the next stage.
- :guilabel:`Red`: the applicant is blocked from moving to the next stage.
- :guilabel:`Gray`: the applicant is still in progress in the current stage and is neither ready nor
  blocked from the next stage.

The status for each card is set manually. To set the status, click on the small circle in the
lower-left of the applicant card. A status pop-up window appears. Click on the desired status for
the applicant. The status dot on the applicant card as well as the status bar updates.

   :align: center
   :alt: The applicant card statuses, and status bar.

.. tip::
   The names for the three status colors (`In Progress`, `Blocked`, and `Ready for Next Stage`)
   :ref:`can be modified <recruitment/modify-stages>` if desired.

.. _recruitment/edit-stage:

Edit stage form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Edit: (Stage)` form is where the stage's settings are configured. The only required
field is the :guilabel:`Stage Name`.

The fields to be populated or modified are:

- :guilabel:`Stage Name`: type in a name for the stage.
- :guilabel:`Email Template`: select an email template to be used from the drop-down menu. If a
  template is selected, when the applicant card enters the stage, an email is automatically sent to
  the applicant using the selected template.
- :guilabel:`Folded in Kanban`: check the box to have the stage appear folded (hidden) at all times
  in the default view.
- :guilabel:`Hired Stage`: check the box if this stage indicates that the applicant is hired. When
  an applicant's card enters this stage, the card displays a :guilabel:`Hired` banner in the upper
  right corner. If this box is checked, this stage is used to determine the hire date of an
  applicant.
- :guilabel:`Job Specific`: if the stage only applies to specific job positions, select the job
  positions from the drop-down menu. Multiple job positions can be selected.
- :guilabel:`Show in Referrals`: check the box if this stage should be seen in the *Referrals*
  application, and allow the referrer to accrue points when a referral of theirs reaches this stage.
  If this is active, a :guilabel:`Points` field appears. Enter the amount of referral points the
  employee receives when an applicant enters this stage. The *Referrals* app must be installed in
  order to use this option.
- :guilabel:`Tooltips` section: there are three pre-configured status labels (colored circles) for
  each applicant's card, indicating its status. These colors are displayed at the top of each stage
  to reflect the statuses of the applicants in the stage. The *names* for the label can be modified,
  but the label itself (the color) cannot. The default names and labels are: :guilabel:`In Progress`
  (gray), :guilabel:`Blocked` (red), and :guilabel:`Ready for Next Stage` (green).
- :guilabel:`Requirements`: enter any internal notes for this stage explaining any requirements of
  the stage.

Delete stage
------------

If a stage is no longer needed, the stage can be deleted. To delete a stage, hover over the name of
the stage, and a :guilabel:`⚙️ (gear)` icon appears. First, click on the :guilabel:`⚙️ (gear)` icon
to reveal a drop-down menu, then click :guilabel:`Delete`. A :guilabel:`Confirmation` pop-up warning
appears, asking :guilabel:`Are you sure you want to delete this column?` Click :guilabel:`Delete`
to delete the column.

.. important::
   If there are applicants currently in the stage being deleted, an error pops up when attempting to
   delete the stage. The records currently in the stage to need to be either deleted, archived, or
   moved to a different stage before the stage can be deleted.

Email templates
===============

To communicate with the applicant, Odoo has several pre-configured email templates that can be used.
The pre-configured email templates and when to use them are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Applicant Acknowledgement`: this template is used to let the applicant
  know that their application was received. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant
  is in the :guilabel:`New` stage.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Interest`: this template is used to let the applicant know that their
  application caught the recruiter's attention, and they have been shortlisted for either a phone
  call or an interview.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Schedule Interview`: this template is used to let the applicant know that
  they have passed the :guilabel:`Initial Qualification` stage and they will be contacted to set up
  an interview with the recruiter. This email is automatically sent out once the applicant is in the
  :guilabel:`Initial Qualification` stage.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Not interested anymore`: this template is used when an applicant
  communicates that they are no longer interested in the position, and thanks them for their time
  and consideration.
- :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse`: this template is used when an applicant is no longer being
  considered for the position.

.. note::
   Email templates can be created, modified, and deleted to suit the needs of a business. For more
   information on email templates, refer to the :doc:`../general/companies/email_template` document.

To manually send an email click :guilabel:`Send message` in the chatter. A text box appears, as well
as the applicant's email address.

.. image:: recruitment/full-composer.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Send an email from the chatter.

Click the :guilabel:`⤢ (double arrow)` full composer icon in the bottom right corner of the
:guilabel:`Send Message` tab in the chatter. A :guilabel:`Compose Email` pop-up window loads, with
the :guilabel:`Recipients` and :guilabel:`Subject` pre-populated. The applicant's email address is
entered in the :guilabel:`Recipients` line, and the :guilabel:`Subject` is `(Job Position)`. The
email body is empty by default.

To use a pre-configured email template, click the field next to :guilabel:`Load template` in the
bottom section of the window. Select the email template to use from the drop-down menu.

Pre-configured email templates may contain dynamic placeholders so unique information can be
populated in the email for a more personalized message to the applicant. There are several
pre-configured email templates to choose from. Depending on the template selected, the email subject
and/or body may change.

.. note::
   Only the email templates that are configured for the model load. There are other email templates
   pre-configured in Odoo, but if they are not configured for the recruitment application, they do
   not appear in the list of available templates.

If any attachments are to be added, click the :guilabel:`Attachments` button in the lower left
corner. Navigate to the file to be attached, then click :guilabel:`Open` to attach it. To delete an
attachment, click the :guilabel:`X (Delete)` icon to the right of the attachment.

If any changes need to be made to the email, edit the body of the email. If the edits should be
saved to be used in the future, the email can be saved as a new template. Click the :guilabel:`Save
Template` button in the bottom. To send the email, click :guilabel:`Send` and the email is sent to
the applicant. The email then appears in the chatter.

Stage flow
==========

In order to move an applicant's card from one stage to another, the applicant's card can either be
dragged and dropped in the Kanban view to the desired stage, or the stage can be modified on the
applicant's card.

To change the stage on the applicant's card, click on the applicant's card in the Kanban view to go
to a detailed view of the card. The current stage for the card is highlighted at the top, above the
card.

Click the desired stage for the card, and the stage changes. A log note indicating the stage change
appears in the chatter. Navigate back to the Kanban view by clicking on :guilabel:`Applications` in
the breadcrumb menu in the top left, and the applicant's card now appears in the new stage.

.. image:: recruitment/stage-change.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Change the stage of an applicant by clicking on the desired stage at the top of the
         applicant's card.

.. _recruitment/new:

New
---

.. important::
   The following information is based on Odoo's default recruitment pipeline flow. Be advised that
   if modifications are made to create a customized recruitment pipeline flow, it varies from the
   following information.

All applicants appear in the :guilabel:`New` stage, whether submitted online or if the applicant is
manually entered by a recruiter.

When the applicant's card is created, Odoo automatically populates the
:guilabel:`Subject/Application`, the applicant's :guilabel:`Name`, :guilabel:`Email`,
:guilabel:`Mobile` number, and :guilabel:`LinkedIn Profile` on the applicant's card. This
information is required when applying for a job position, by default.

.. note::
   If the website application form is modified, different fields may be populated based on what
   information is requested on the website.

If the applicant entered any information in the :guilabel:`Short Introduction` section of the online
application, it is populated in the :guilabel:`Application Summary` tab at the bottom of the
applicant's card.

Resumé
~~~~~~

If a resumé was attached to the online application, the resumé appears in the attachments section of
the chatter, and is also stored in the *Documents* application. To find the recruitment documents
stored in the *Documents* application, navigate to the main :menuselection:`Documents` dashboard,
and click the folder labeled :guilabel:`Recruitment` on the left-hand side. All recruitment
documents are stored within that folder.

If the :ref:`CV Display <recruitment/cv-display>` option was enabled in the :ref:`Settings
<recruitment/settings>` menu, the resumé appears on the applicant's card, on the right-hand side.

Send interview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At any point in the hiring process, an *interview* can be sent to the applicant to obtain more
information. These interviews are custom-made, and can be formatted in a variety of ways.

The *Surveys* application is used to send these *interviews*, therefore the *Surveys* application
must be installed to send an interview to an applicant.

Odoo uses the term *interview*, but these can be thought of as questionnaires, surveys, tests,
certifications, etc. Custom interviews can be formatted to suit each individual job positions
needs. For more information on creating and editing interview forms, refer to the
:doc:`../hr/recruitment/new_job` documentation.

.. example::
   A job position for a computer programmer could have an interview in the form of a programming
   quiz to determine the skill level of the applicant. A job position for a restaurant server could
   have a questionnaire inquiring about the applicant's availability, if the desired applicant needs
   to be available on weekend evenings.

To send an interview to an applicant, click on an applicant's card to navigate to a detailed view of
the applicant's card. At the top-left of the applicant's card, click the :guilabel:`Send Interview`
button.

If the applicant's card has an email address on file, a :guilabel:`Send an interview` pop-up window
appears, with all the information populated.

.. note::
   In order to send an email to an applicant, there must be an email address on the applicant's
   card. If an email address is not entered on the applicant's card, when :guilabel:`Send Interview`
   is clicked, an :guilabel:`Edit:(Applicant)` pop-up window appears on top of the :guilabel:`Send
   an interview` pop-up window. Enter the email address in the :guilabel:`email` field, then click
   :guilabel:`Save & Close`. Once the applicant's information is saved, the :guilabel:`Edit:
   (Applicant)` closes and the :guilabel:`Send an interview` pop-up window remains.

Email templates use dynamic placeholders to personalize the email to the applicant and the job
position. Add any additional recipients for the survey if more people should receive the email. If
an email is in the database as a contact, add that contact in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field. If
an email should be sent to someone who is not in the database as a contact, and they should **not**
be added as a contact, add their email in the :guilabel:`Additional emails` field.

If any attachments need to be added, click the :guilabel:`Attachments` button and a file explorer
window appears. Navigate to the desired file, then click :guilabel:`Open` to attach it to the email.
The attachment loads, and is listed above the :guilabel:`Attachments` button.

If the emailed interview must be completed by a specific date, select a date for the
:guilabel:`Answer deadline` in the lower-right area of the pop-up window. Click on the line next to
:guilabel:`Answer deadline`, and a calendar selector appears. Use the :guilabel:`< (left)` and
:guilabel:`> (right)` arrows on either side of the month to navigate to the desired month, then
click on the :guilabel:`day` to select the date.

The :guilabel:`Mail Template` field is pre-populated based on the configuration for the interview. A
different template can be chosen from the drop-down menu if desired. If a new template is selected,
the new email template loads in the email body.

To send the email with the interview link to the applicant, click :guilabel:`Send` at the bottom of
the email pop-up.

.. image:: recruitment/send-survey.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Send a custom survey, also referred to as an interview form, to an applicant using a
         pre-configured template.

Refuse
~~~~~~

At any point in the recruitment pipeline, an applicant can be refused from the job application
process. To refuse an applicant, click on an applicant's card to navigate to a detailed view of the
applicant's card. At the top of the applicant's card, there are several buttons. Click the one
labeled :guilabel:`Refuse`.

A :guilabel:`Refuse Reason` pop-up window appears. Click the :guilabel:`Refuse Reason` from the
presented options. The default refuse reasons in Odoo, and their corresponding email templates, are:

- :guilabel:`Doesn't fit the job requirements`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse` email
  template.
- :guilabel:`Refused by Applicant: don't like job`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Not interested
  anymore` email template.
- :guilabel:`Refused by Applicant: better offer`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Not interested
  anymore` email template.
- :guilabel:`Language issues`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse` email template.
- :guilabel:`Role already fulfilled`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse` email template.
- :guilabel:`Duplicate`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse` email template.
- :guilabel:`Spam`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Refuse` email template.
- :guilabel:`Refused by Applicant: salary`: uses the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Not interested anymore`
  email template.

Additional refusal reasons :ref:`can be created and existing ones can be modified or deleted
<recruitment/new-refuse>`.

.. note::
   Pre-configured email templates in Odoo sometimes use dynamic placeholders, which are customized
   pieces of data that populate dynamic content. For example, if the applicant's name is a piece of
   dynamic content, the applicant's name appears anytime that dynamic placeholder appears on the
   email template. For more detailed information on email templates, refer to the
   :doc:`../general/companies/email_template` documentation.

After a :guilabel:`Refuse Reason` is selected, two fields appear below the refusal reason:
:guilabel:`Send Email` and :guilabel:`Email Template`.

The applicant's email automatically populated the :guilabel:`Send Email` field; additional emails
cannot be added. If an email should **not** be sent to the applicant, uncheck the :guilabel:`Send
Email` checkbox.

The email template associated with the refusal reason populates the :guilabel:`Email Template`
field. If a different email template is desired, select a different template from the
:guilabel:`Email Template` drop-down menu. To view the email template, click the :guilabel:`External
Link` icon to the right of the :guilabel:`Email Template` field. The email template loads in a
:guilabel:`Open: Email Template` pop-up window, and can be modified if needed. After making
modifications, click :guilabel:`Save & Close`.

To send the refusal email to the applicant, click :guilabel:`Refuse`. The refusal email is sent to
the applicant, and a :guilabel:`Refused` banner appears on the applicant's card in the top-right
corner.

.. image:: recruitment/refuse.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An applicant's card with the refused banner appearing in the top-right corner in red.

After refusal, the applicant's card is no longer visible in the job position's Kanban view. To view
the refused applicants only, click the :guilabel:`▼ Toggle Search Panel` button in the search box,
then click :guilabel:`Refused` under the :guilabel:`Filters` section. All applicants that have been
refused for the job position appear, in the stage they were when they were refused.

To view all applicants that have been refused from all job positions, navigate to the
:menuselection:`Recruitment app --> Applications --> All Applications`. Click the :guilabel:`▼
Toggle Search Panel` button in the search box, then click :guilabel:`Refused` under the
:guilabel:`Filters` section. All applications for all job positions are presented in a list view,
organized by stage.

.. _recruitment/new-refuse:

To make any modifications to a refuse reason, click on the line, and make any desired changes.

New applicant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An applicant card can be manually added if needed. If an applicant needs to be added to the list of
prospective candidates and an applicant card has not been created yet (they have not applied for the
job online) an applicant card can be easily added from the job position Kanban view in one of two
ways, using either the :ref:`Quick add <recruitment/quick-add-applicant>` icon or the :ref:`New
<recruitment/create-new-applicant>` button.

.. _recruitment/quick-add-applicant:

Quick add
*********

Quickly add a new applicant using the :guilabel:`Quick add` icon. If not already in the job position
Kanban view, navigate to the main recruitment dashboard by going to :menuselection:`Recruitment app
--> Applications --> By Job Positions`. Click the :guilabel:`(#) New Applications` button on the job
position card that the applicant should be added to. Then, click on the small :guilabel:`+ (plus
sign) Quick add` icon in the top right of the :guilabel:`New` stage to quickly add a new applicant.

Enter the following information on the card:

- :guilabel:`Subject/Application`: Enter the title for the card. Typically this is the applicant's
  name and job position being applied to, for example: `Laura Smith - HR Manager`. This field is not
  visible in the Kanban view, unless the :guilabel:`Applicant's Name` is left blank. If there is no
  :guilabel:`Applicant's Name`, then the :guilabel:`Subject/Application Name` is what is displayed
  on the applicant card in the Kanban view.
- :guilabel:`Applicant's Name`: enter the applicant's name.
- :guilabel:`Email`: enter the applicant's email address.
- :guilabel:`Applied Job`: the current job position populates this field. If needed, the job
  position can be changed by selecting a different position from the drop-down menu. If a different
  job position is selected, after the card is created, the card appears in the selected job
  position.

After the information is entered, click :guilabel:`Add`. The applicant appears in the list, and a
new blank applicant card appears. Click either the :guilabel:`🗑️ (delete)` icon or anywhere on the

.. _recruitment/initial-qualification:

Initial qualification
---------------------

If an applicant seems to be a good potential candidate, they are moved to the :guilabel:`Initial
Qualification` stage. This could be for a number of reasons, such as they have the relevant
experience, education, or certifications the position requires.

This stage is to quickly sort candidates that have potential, and those that do not meet the
requirements. No automatic actions, such as emails, are set for this stage. This stage simply
informs the recruitment team to potentially set up a phone call or an interview with the candidate.

.. _recruitment/first-interview:

First interview
---------------

After an applicant has passed the :guilabel:`Initial Qualification` stage, they can be moved to the
:guilabel:`First Interview` stage in the job position Kanban view. To move the applicant to the next
stage, drag and drop the applicant's card to the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, or click on the
:guilabel:`First Interview` stage button at the top of the individual applicant's card.

.. image:: recruitment/move.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An applicant's card moves from one stage to another by using the click and drag method.

.. tip::
   The :guilabel:`First Interview` stage can be modified so when the applicant's card moves to the
   :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, an email is automatically sent to the applicant stating an
   interview is requested. In this pre-configured email template, a link to the recruiting team's
   calendar appears, allowing the applicant to schedule their interview.

   :ref:`Edit <recruitment/edit-stage>` the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, and select the
   :guilabel:`Recruitment: Schedule Interview` for the :guilabel:`Email Template` field, to automate
   this action.

.. _recruitment/schedule-meetings:

Schedule a meeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interview can be scheduled in one of two ways: either manually by the recruitment team, or by the
applicant themselves.

If the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage was modified to send the :guilabel:`Recruitment: Schedule
Interview` email template when an applicant reaches that stage, the applicant received a link to the
recruitment team's calendar, and can schedule the interview on their own. The recruitment team's
availability is reflected in the calendar.

If the interview needs to be scheduled by the recruitment team, they should reach out to the
applicant for a date and time that works. When a date and time have been agreed upon for both the
applicant and interviewer, the interview can be scheduled. To schedule an interview, whether a phone
or in-person interview, click the :guilabel:`Meeting` smart button at the top of the applicant's
record.

.. note::
   The meeting smart button displays :guilabel:`No Meeting` if no meetings are currently scheduled.
   For new applicants who are new to the :guilabel:`First Interview` stage, this is the default.

   If there is one meeting already scheduled, the smart button displays :guilabel:`1 Meeting`, with
   the date of the upcoming meeting beneath it. If more than one meeting is scheduled, the button
   displays :guilabel:`Next Meeting`, with the date of the first upcoming meeting beneath it.

Doing so loads the *Calendar* application, showing the currently scheduled meetings and events for
the user. The meetings and events displayed are for the employees who are listed under the
:guilabel:`Attendees` section on the right side of the calendar view. To change the currently loaded
meetings and events being displayed, uncheck the person who's calendar events are to be hidden. Only
the checked attendees are visible on the calendar.

The default view is the :guilabel:`Week` view. To change the calendar view, click the
:guilabel:`Week` button, then select the desired view from the drop-down menu. The other options are
either :guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Month`, or :guilabel:`Year`.

An option to display or hide weekends is available. Click the :guilabel:`Week` button, then click
:guilabel:`Show weekends` to deactivate it (the default is to show weekends). If a check mark is
next to :guilabel:`Show weekends`, weekends are visible. If there is no check mark, weekends are
hidden.

To change the displayed date range for the calendar, either use the :guilabel:`← (Left arrow)`,
:guilabel:`→ (Right arrow)`, or :guilabel:`Today` buttons above the calendar, or click on a date in
the calendar on the right side of the displayed calendar.

.. image:: recruitment/calendar.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The calendar view, highlighting how to change the displayed meetings.

To add a meeting to the calendar when in the day or week view, click on the start time of the
meeting and drag to the end time, to select the date, time, and the length of the meeting. A meeting
can also be added in this view by clicking on the day *and* the time slot the meeting is to take
place.

Both methods cause a :ref:`New Event <recruitment/event-card>` pop up window to appear.
