.. _manufacturing/management/bill-configuration:

A *bill of materials* (or *BoM* for short) documents the component quantities needed for a product,
often including production operations and step-by-step guidelines.

BoM setup
=========

To create a |BOM|, go to :menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bills of Materials` and
click :guilabel:`New`.

Next, set the :guilabel:`BoM Type` to :guilabel:`Manufacture this Product`.

Then, specify :ref:`required components <manufacturing/basic_setup/setup-components>` and, if
necessary, define any :ref:`manufacturing operations <manufacturing/basic_setup/setup-operations>`.

.. note::
   Alternatively, |BOMs| can also be created by clicking the :guilabel:`Bill of Materials` smart
   button on any product form.

Components
----------

In the :guilabel:`Components` tab of a |BOM|, specify components used to manufacture the product by
clicking :guilabel:`Add a line`. From the :guilabel:`Components` drop-down menu, select from
existing products or create a new product by typing the name and selecting the :guilabel:`Create...`
option.

Operations
----------

Add an :guilabel:`Operation` to a |BOM| to specify instructions for production and register time
spent on an operation. To use this feature, first enable the *Work Orders* feature by going to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`. In the :guilabel:`Operations`
section, tick the :guilabel:`Work Orders` checkbox to enable the feature.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../advanced_configuration/work_order_dependencies`

.. image:: bill_configuration/enable-work-orders.png

Next, navigate to the |BOM| by going to :menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Bill of
Materials` and selecting the desired |BOM|. To add a new operation, go to the :guilabel:`Operations`
tab, and click :guilabel:`Add a line`.

Doing so opens the :guilabel:`Create Operations` pop-up window, where the various fields of the
operation are configured:

- :guilabel:`Operation`: name of the operation.
- :guilabel:`Work Center`: select existing locations to perform the operation, or create a new work
  center by typing the name and selecting the :guilabel:`Create...` option.
- :guilabel:`Apply on Variants`: specify if this operation is only available for certain product
  variants. If the operation applies to all product variants, leave this field blank.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Configuring BoMs for product variants <../advanced_configuration/product_variants>`

- :guilabel:`Duration Computation`: choose how time spent on the operation is tracked. Opt for
  :guilabel:`Compute based on tracked time` use the operation's time tracker or :guilabel:`Set
  duration manually` if operators can record and modify time themselves.
- :guilabel:`Default Duration`: estimated amount of time to complete the operation; used for
  `planning manufacturing orders <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK55jIq00pc>`_ and determining
  `work center availability <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YwFlD97Bio>`_.
- :guilabel:`Company`: specify the company the |BOM| is available in.

Include operation details in the :guilabel:`Work Sheet` tab. Choose :guilabel:`PDF` to attach a file
or :guilabel:`Google Slide` to share a link. Select :guilabel:`Text` to type instructions in the
:guilabel:`Description` text field.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to close the pop-up window. To add more operations, click
:guilabel:`Save & New` and repeat the same steps above to configure another operation.

.. note::
   Each operation is unique, as it is always exclusively linked to one |BOM|.

.. tip::
   After creating an operation, click the :guilabel:`Copy Existing Operations` button to choose an
   operation to duplicate.

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   To add detailed instructions to operations, the *Quality* app must be installed.

Add specific instructions to an existing operation by clicking the operation's |list| icon in the
:guilabel:`Instructions` column. The number in the :guilabel:`Instructions` column shows the number
of existing detailed instructions there are for the operation.

Click :guilabel:`New` to open a quality control point form. Here, give the specific instruction a
:guilabel:`Title` and change the :guilabel:`Type` to :guilabel:`Instructions`. For more details
about quality control points refer to the following:

.. seealso::

Add by-products to BoMs
=======================

A *by-product* is a residual product that is created during production in addition to the main
product of a |BOM|. Unlike the primary product, there can be more than one by-product on a |BOM|.

To add by-products to a |BOM|, first enable the :guilabel:`By-Products` feature in
:menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`. In the :guilabel:`Operations`
section, tick the checkbox for :guilabel:`By-Products` to enable the feature.

.. image:: bill_configuration/by-products.png
   :align: center
   :alt: "By Products" feature in the settings page.

Once the feature is enabled, add by-products to a |BOM| by clicking the :guilabel:`By-products` tab.
Click :guilabel:`Add a line`, and fill in the :guilabel:`By-product`, :guilabel:`Quantity`, and
:guilabel:`Unit of Measure`. Optionally, specify a :guilabel:`Produced in Operation` for the
by-product.

.. example::
   The by-product, `Mush`, is created in the `Grind grapes` operation when producing `Red Wine`.
